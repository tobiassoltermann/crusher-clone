I created a web-based clone of an old classical game, created in 1991.
The game created by Soleau Software for the DOS platform was about the first game I’ve ever played on a computer. 

I’ve always wanted to experiment with Electron (a framework that allows packaging web technology into a more native experience).

Because of that and because I loved this game, I decided to build a web-based clone.

Credits are due to the original creator, because gameplay, audio and graphical assets were just bluntly cloned.

The project is based on HTML5/CSS/JS. No additional engine was used, just a plain Canvas element.
